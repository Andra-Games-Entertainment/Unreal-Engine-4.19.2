[EXCERPT:Overview]
Regardless of what Animation Tool you are working in, each Editor will feature a **Toolbar** which can be located at the top. However, the options on the Toolbar will vary based on the type of Editor you are currently working in.
The Toolbar is comprised of two main areas, the **Asset Toolbar** which contains several options related to the Editor you are working with and the **Editor Toolbar** which enables you to quickly switch between the different Animation Tool Editors.

## Asset Toolbar

Located along the left side of the Toolbar are the options that are available based on the type of Editor you are working with, refer to the sections below: 

### Skeleton Editor Toolbar

![](SkeletonToolbar.png)

The Skeleton Editor Toolbar is shown whenever you open [](Engine/Animation/Skeleton) and contains the following options: 

|Option | Description |
| ------- | ------------ |
| ![](saveIcon.png) | Saves any changes made to the current Skeleton asset.  |
| ![](findincbIcon.png) | Opens the **Content Browser** and automatically navigates to the current Skeleton asset. |
| ![](animnotifiesIcon.png) | Opens the [Anim Notifies](Engine/Animation/Persona/AnimationNotifies) window that displays all the custom Animation Notifies for the current Skeleton. |
| ![](retargetmanagerIcon.png) | Opens the [](Engine/Animation/Persona/BasePoseManager) which enables you to manage your retarget sources, set up rigs and define retarged base poses for use with Animation Retargeting. |
| ![](importmeshIcon.png) | Begins the [](Engine/Content/FBX/SkeletalMeshes) and enables you to import a new Skeletal Mesh for the current Skeleton.  |
| ![](PreviewMesh.png) | Set a new preview Skeletal Mesh for the current asset (stored per-animation or per-skeleton). |
| ![](makestaticmeshIcon.png) | Enables you to create a **Static Mesh** out of the current preview pose. |

### Skeletal Mesh Editor Toolbar

![](MeshToolbar.png)

The Skeletal Mesh Editor Toolbar is shown whenever you open a [Skeletal Mesh](Engine/Content/Types/SkeletalMeshes) asset and contains the following options: 

|Option | Description |
| ------- | ------------ |
| ![](saveIcon.png) | Saves any changes made to the current Skeletal Mesh asset.  |
| ![](findincbIcon.png) | Opens the **Content Browser** and automatically navigates to the current Skeletal Mesh asset. |
| ![](reimportmeshIcon.png) | Enables you to reimport the current Skeletal Mesh and starts the FBX Import Process.  |
| ![](SectionSelection.png) | Enables selecting Mesh Sections in the viewport (disables selecting bones using their physics shape). |
| ![](makestaticmeshIcon.png) | Enables you to create a **Static Mesh** out of the current preview pose. |

### Animation Editor Toolbar

![](AnimationToolbar.png)

The Animation Editor Toolbar is shown whenever you open any animation assets (Animation Sequences, Anim Montages, Blend Spaces, etc.) and contains the following options: 

|Option | Description |

When creating animation, this can be based on the **Reference Pose**, **Current Pose** or Current Animation's **Animation Data** or **Preview Mesh**. When using the Preview Mesh, the created animation will include any additional animation data generated from a post-process graph assigned tot he Skeletal Mesh, such as Anim Dynamics for Physics Simulation.   |
| ![](ReimportAnimation.png) | Reimport the current animation. |
| ![](compressionIcon.png) | Enables you to apply different [Compression](Engine/Animation/Sequences) settings to the animation (available for Animation Sequences). |
| ![](ExportAsset.png) | Export current animation source data or current animation playing on the current preview mesh (includes retargeting, post process graph or other settings applied to the preview mesh).   |

| ![](applyIcon.png) | Applies [Additive Layer Tracks](Engine/Animation/AnimHowTo/LayerEditing) to Runtime Animation Data. |
| ![](PreviewMesh.png) | Set a new preview Skeletal Mesh for the current asset (stored per-animation or per-skeleton). |
| ![](makestaticmeshIcon.png) | Enables you to create a **Static Mesh** out of the current preview pose. |

### Animation Blueprint Editor Toolbar

![](AnimBPToolbar.png)

The Animation Blueprint Editor Toolbar is shown whenever you open any [](Engine/Animation/AnimBlueprints) and enables you to Save, Find the Animation Blueprint in the Content Browser or create a Static Mesh from the current preview pose.

## Editor Toolbar

Located along the right side of each editor toolbar is the **Editor Toolbar** which enables you to switch between each of the Animation Tool Editors. 

The currently open editor will be highlighted: 
  
 ![](SkeletonToolbar.png)
 
 When clicking one of the other Editors, the new tab will open, and the new editor will be highlighted: 

 ![](MeshToolbar.png)

 The **Animation Editor** includes an animation selection drop-down button next to the icon to quickly change the preview animation: 

![](animationdropdownmenu.png)

A ** * (Asterisk) ** symbol in the lower left corner of the icon indicates that the asset has changes that have not been saved. 

![](unsavedasset.png)

Based on the assets in your project, some of the editors may not appear on the toolbar. 

For example, if you have imported a Skeletal Mesh and created a Skeleton, but have no animations or Animation Blueprints, your toolbar may look like below. 

![](limitedtoolbar.png)

Creating an Animation Blueprint with the associated Skeleton and importing animations linked to the Skeleton will allow you to access the other editors for that asset.
