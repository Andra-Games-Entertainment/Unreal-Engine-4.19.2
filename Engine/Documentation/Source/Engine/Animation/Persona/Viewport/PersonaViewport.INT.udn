The **Timeline** and **Control bar** contain the following controls:

| Control | Description |

| ![Control bar - Step Backward](CE_button_step_back.png) | Skips to the previous frame in the AnimationSequence or AnimationMontage. |
| ![Control bar - Play in Reverse](CE_button_play_back.png) ![Control bar - Pause](CE_button_pause.png) | Begins playback of the AnimationSequence or AnimationMontage in reverse. When playing, the pause button is displayed. |
| ![Control bar - Play Forward](CE_button_play_forward.png) ![Control bar - Pause](CE_button_pause.png) | Begins playback of the AnimationSequence or AnimationMontage. When playing, the pause button is displayed. |

[REGION:note]
When opening a Blend Space or Aim Offset, the animation will play automatically if **Preview** is enabled. If you pause or disable the looping option in an AnimationSequence or AnimationMontage and then open a Blend Space or Aim Offset, the animation will not automatically play. You will need to set an animation to play/looping in order for it to autostart when opening a Blend Space or Aim Offset.
