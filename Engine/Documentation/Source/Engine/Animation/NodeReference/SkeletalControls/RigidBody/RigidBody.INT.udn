The **Rigid Body** Skeletal Control node can be used to create large amounts of physically-simulated characters using the high-performance **Immediate Mode** PhysX API. 
The Rigid Body node (pictued below) can be added to the **AnimGraph** of your [](Engine/Animation/AnimBlueprints) and can even be used with any [](Engine/Animation/NodeReference/Blend/), enabling you to switch from a pose into a simulated physics state.
Characters using this simulation can also generate collision with static geometry in the world.

Using this node, several simulated characters below are able to respond to an impulse and switch from an idle into a physics simulated state.

## Setup

Before using this node, inside your [Physics Asset](Engine/Physics/PhAT) set the [](Engine/Physics/PhysicsBodies/) you want to simulate to **Simulated**. 

![](RigidBody_02.png)

[REGION:caption]
Above we **Right-clicked** on our character's **Pelvis** bone and set all bodies below it to **Simulated** so our character fully simulates physics. 
[/REGION]

With your Physics Asset set up, inside the AnimGraph of your Animation Blueprint, add the Rigid Body node and the necessary logic to define when to use it.

[REGION:caption]
Above the Rigid Body node is connected to a blend node that we switch to when the characters are affected by our impulse, causing them to simulate physics. 
[/REGION]

With the Rigid Body node selected, you can change properites that define how the node is used from the **Details** panel.

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| **Override Physics Asset** | Physics asset to use. If empty, the Skeletal Mesh's default Physics Asset will be used. |
| **Override World Gravity** | Enables specification of a vector value to override gravity for this body. |
| **Overlap Channel** | The channel used to find static geometry to collide with. |
| **Component Space Simulation** | When true, simulation is done in component space. This means velocity is only inherited by animated bodies.|
| **Cached Bounds Scale** | Scale of cached bounds (versus actual bounds). Increasing this may improve performance, but overlaps may not work as well. A value of 1.0 effectively disables cached bounds. |
| **(As Pin) Alpha** | Shows the Alpha property as a pin on the node or in the Details panel. |
| **Alpha Scale Bias** | Set the Minimal and Maximal Influence values for the Alpha property. |
