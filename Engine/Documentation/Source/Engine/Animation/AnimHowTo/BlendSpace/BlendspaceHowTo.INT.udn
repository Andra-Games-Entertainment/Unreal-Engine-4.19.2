[Blend Spaces](Engine/Animation/Blendspaces) are special assets which can be sampled in **AnimGraphs** that allow for blending of animations based on the values of two inputs. 
Simple blending between two animations based on a single input can be performed using one of the standard [Blend Nodes](Engine/Animation/NodeReference/Blend) available in Animation Blueprints. 
Blend Spaces provide a means of doing more complex blending between multiple animations based on multiple values (currently limited to two).

In this How-to, we use a Blend Space to blend between walking and jogging animations based on the character's movement speed and movement direction.

## Steps

1.  In your project in the **Content/ThirdPersonBP/Blueprints** folder, open the **ThirdPersonGameMode** and set the **Default Pawn Class** to **Ue4ASP_Character**. 

	![](BlendSpace1.png)

	This will allow us to use the playable character that was created along with the Animation Starter Pack project. 

1.	In the Level, select the **ThirdPersonCharacter** and delete it from the level. 

	![](BlendSpace2.png)

	We need to delete this character from the level in order to spawn in as the character from the previous step. 

1.	In the **Content/AnimStarterPack/UE4_Mannequin/Mesh** folder, **Right-click** on the **UE4_Mannequin** and under **Create**, select **Blend Space**. 

	![](BlendSpace3.png)

	Blend Space assets need a Skeleton asset to reference, here we are using a shortcut to create a Blend Space from this Skeleton asset. 

1.	In the **Parameters** section, apply the values below then press the **Apply Parameter Changes** button. 

	![](BlendSpace4.png)

	* Set the **X Axis Label** to **Direction**
	* Set the **X Axis Range** to **-180 - 180**
	* Set the **Y Axis Label** to **Speed**
	* Set the **Y Axis Range** to **150 - 260**

	This Blend Space using the parameters **Direction** and **Speed** to determine which pose we should be using or blending to or from. 

1.	In the **Asset Browser**, drag the **Walk_Fwd_Rifle_Ironsights** animation to the center-bottom position on the grid. 

	![](BlendSpace5.png)

	Placing this animation here indicates that when our Speed is 150 and are direction is not left or right, we should be walking forward with our rifle up at ironsights level. 

1.	Drag the **Walk_Lt_Rifle_Ironsights** animation to location **1** and **Walk_Rt_Rifle_Ironsights** animation to location **2** below. 

	![](BlendSpace6.png)

	Here we place the animations to use when moving left or right and our speed is 150. 

1.	Drag the **Walk_Bwd_Rifle_Ironsights** animation to locations **1** and **2** below.

	![](BlendSpace7.png)

	Here we place the animation to use when moving backward and our speed it 150. 

1.	From the **Asset Browser**, drag the **Jog_Fwd_Rifle** animation to the top-center position on the grid. 

	![](BlendSpace8.png)

	This allows us to use a different animation when our speed is at max 270 and we are not moving left or right, we are jogging forward. 

1.	Drag the **Jog_Lt_Rifle** animation to location **1** and **Jog_Rt_Rifle** animation to location **2** below. 

	![](BlendSpace9.png)

1.	Drag the **Jog_Bwd_Rifle** animation to locations **1** and **2** below.

	![](BlendSpace10.png)

1.	In the **Content/AnimStarterPack** folder, open the **UE4ASP_HeroTPP_AnimBlueprint** then in the **My Blueprint** panel, **Double-click** the **Locomotion** graph. 

	![](BlendSpace11.png)

1.	**Double-click** the **Jog** State to open its graph. 

	![](BlendSpace12.png)

	This [State Machine](Engine/Animation/StateMachines) already has a Jog State and in it, a Blend Space for different Jogging motions. 

1.	From the **Asset Browser**, drag the **Walk_Jog_BS** into the graph and replace the **BS_Jog** Blend Space as shown below. 

	![](BlendSpace13.png)

	The default Blend Space does not include Walking states which our Blend Space does, so let's replace it with ours! 

1.	In the **Content/AnimStarterPack** folder, open the **Ue4ASP_Character**. 

1.	Locate the section marked **Crouch** in the graph and replace the **InputAction Crouch** node with a **C** Key Event. 

	![](BlendSpace14.png)

	By default, the Animation Starter Pack has bindings created for crouch which we will replace with a normal **C** press (or whatever key you want to crouch with). 

1.	**Right-click** in the graph and add a **Left Shift** Key Event, then drag the **CharacterMovement** into the graph from the **Components** tab. 

	![](BlendSpace15.png)

	When we press and hold the Left Shift button, that will toggle us from walking into a jog. 

1.	Hold the **B** key and **Left-click** in the graph and create two **Branch** nodes, then drag in the **Crouch Button Down** variable and connect as shown below. 

	![](BlendSpace16.png)

	We need to check and make sure that we are not crouching while holding shift (as for this example, sprinting can only occur when not crouched). 

1.	Drag off the **CharacterMovement** node and **Set Max Walk Speed** for both **Branch** nodes with the values **260** and **150** respectively. 

	![](BlendSpace17.png)

	We are changing our movement speed based on if Left Shift is held and will alter our character's movement speed in game. 

1.	**Right-click** in the graph and add an **Event Begin Play** node and connect a **CharacterMovement** component to **Set Max Walk Speed** to **150**. 

	![](BlendSpace20.png)

	To start the game, we need to update our character's default movement speed so they start out walking. 

1.	Click the **CapsuleComponent** in the **Components** tab and in the **Details** panel, check the **Hidden in Game** option. 

	![](BlendSpace18.png)

	This will turn off the collision capsule debug display in game. 

1.	Click the **CharacterMovement** component, then in the **Details** panel set the **Max Walk Speed** to **260**. 

	![](BlendSpace19.png)

	Here we are capping the maximum movement speed to reflect what is in our Blend Space. 

1.	Click **Compile** then click the **Play** in editor button from the Toolbar.

When playing in the Editor, using **WASD** to move around, the character will now walk by default and blend between walking animations when changing directions. 
While standing, pressing and holding **Left Shift** while using WASD will cause the character to blend from the walk/aim animation to a lowered/aim jog animation, essentially creating a sprint for the character. 
You can also press and hold **C**, to crouch walk using the Blend Space that was created as part of the Animation Starter Pack project, blending between crouch walking animations.
