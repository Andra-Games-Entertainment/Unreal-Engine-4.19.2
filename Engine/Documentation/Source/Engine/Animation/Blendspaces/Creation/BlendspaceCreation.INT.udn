This page covers how to create both **Blend Space** and **Blend Space 1D** assets as you will need to select a [Skeleton](Engine/Animation/Skeleton) to associate the Blend Space with.

[REGION:note]
Creating a Blend Space and Blend Space 1D are generally the same, however, [](Engine/Animation/Blendspaces/Editor) slightly differs based on which asset you are working with. 
[/REGION]

1. In the **Content Browser**, click the **Add New** button (or **Right-click** in the Content Browser) and choose **Animation** > **Blend Space**.

	If you would like to create a **Blend Space 1D**, select the option for Blend Space 1D instead.
