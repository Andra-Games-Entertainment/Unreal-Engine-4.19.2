[TOC (start:2 end:3)]

When you cook your game for release or test on non-editor platforms, **Chunking** can be used to split your data into several .pak files that can then be independently deployed. Chunking is now integrated into the Asset Manager, and it can be set up using **Primary Asset Labels** or **Rules Overrides**. The best example of chunking can be found in the ShooterGame sample project. ShooterGame establishes three chunks: Chunk 1 for the "Sanctuary" map, Chunk 2 for the "Highrise" map, and Chunk 0 for all other data. For [ShooterGame](Resources/SampleGames/ShooterGame), Primary Asset Labels were chosen, but we will discuss both methods.


## Primary Asset Labels

**Primary Asset Label** is a minimal override of `UPrimaryDataAsset` that is set up to designate other assets for chunking and cooking. While they are not usually loaded during the game, they are used when cooking and chunking and can set up their own rules, lists, and priorities for other project assets. In the case of ShooterGame, labels were created to designate the assets that would be placed into the various chunks.

At this point, the asset for "Highrise" is associated with its own Primary Asset ID, "Map:/Game/Maps/Highrise", as well as the Primary Asset ID of "HighriseLabel", "PrimaryAssetLabel:HighriseLabel". Because the map has no Chunk ID of its own, the chunking process will use the Chunk ID found in "HighriseLabel", which is 2. In addition, all Secondary Assets in the map will be associated with Chunk 2. A similar setup will need to be made for the "Sanctuary" map and Chunk 1.

## Rules Overrides

**Rules Overrides** can be used to establish the priority and Chunk settings for a specific Primary Asset. To build our three-chunk setup for ShooterGame using Rules Overrides instead of Primary Asset Labels, the following section should be created in `DefaultGame.ini`:

	[/Script/Engine.AssetManagerSettings]
	+PrimaryAssetRules=(PrimaryAssetId="Map:/Game/Maps/Sanctuary", Rules=(Priority=-1,ChunkId=1,CookRule=Unknown))
	+PrimaryAssetRules=(PrimaryAssetId="Map:/Game/Maps/Highrise", Rules=(Priority=-1,ChunkId=2,CookRule=Unknown))
	+PrimaryAssetRules=(PrimaryAssetId="Map:/Game/Maps/ShooterEntry", Rules=(Priority=-1,ChunkId=0,CookRule=AlwaysCook))

This sets our main game maps to be in specific chunks, which will cause all of their references to be added to those chunks as well. The final entry, governing Chunk 0, ensures that anything referenced by the map that loads when the game first starts up will be in Chunk 0, which is also the default Chunk.
