In the **Asset Details** panel under the **Clothing** section, you can define the various properties of your clothing that is assigned to the mesh's Material Elements. These properties
define how your cloth will react so that you can have different types of cloth that act like silk, burlap, rubber, etc.

[REGION:simpletable]
| Property  | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [REGION:tablesection] Mesh Clothing Assets [/REGION] ||
| Name | The name given to the the created or imported Cloth asset. |
| Details | Specific details about the cloth asset, such as the number of vertices simulating, fixed vertices, bones, etc. |
| [REGION:tablesection] Cloth Config [/REGION] ||
| Wind Method | A selection for how wind should be processed. [INLCUDE:#windmethod] |
| Vertical Constraint Config | Constraint data used for vertical constraints. [INCLUDE:#constrconfig] |
| Horizontal Constraint Config | Constraint data used for horizontal constraints. [INCLUDE:#constrconfig] |

| Damping | The damping of particle motions per-axis (XYZ).  |
| Friction | The friction of the surface when colliding. |
| Wind Drag Coefficient | Drag coefficient for wind calculations. Higher values mean that wind has more lateral effect on the cloth. |
| Wind Lift Coefficient | Lift coefficient for wind calculations. Higher values make cloth rise easier in the wind. |
| Linear Drag | Drag that is applied to linear particle movement per-axis (XYZ). |
| Angular Drag | Drag that is applied to angular particle movement. Higher values should limit material bending (per-axis XYZ). |
| Linear Inertia Scale | Scale for linear particle inertia. This controls how much movement should translate to linear motion per-axis (XYZ). |
| Angular Inertia Scale | Scale for angular particle inertia. This controls how much movement should translate to angular motion per-axis (XYZ). |
| Centrifugal Inertia Scale | Scale for centrifugal inertia. This controls how much movement should translate to angular motion per-axis (XYZ). |
| Solver Frequency | The frequency of the position solver. Lower values will lead to stretchier, bouncier cloth. |
| Stiffness Frequency | The frequency stiffness calculation. Lower values will degrade stiffness of constraints. |
| Gravity Scale | The scale of gravity's effect on particles. |
| Tether Stiffness | The scale for stiffness of particle tethers between each other. |
| Tether Limit | The scale for the limit of particle tethers. This controls how far they can separate. |
| Collision Thickness | This adjusts the thickness of the cloth, used to adjust collisions.  |

[EXCERPT:windmethod]
| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Legacy | This mode uses accelerations modified directly by the simulation with no regard for drag or lift. |
| Accurate| Use the updated wind calculation for NvCloth based solver, taking into account drag and lift. This will require those properties to be correctly set in the clothing configuration. |
[/EXCERPT:windmethod]

[EXCERPT:constrconfig]
| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Stiffness | How stiff this constraint is. This affects how closely it will follow the desired position. |
| Stiffness Multiplier | A multiplier that affects the value set for **Stiffness**. |
| Stretch Limit | The hard limit on how far this constraint can stretch. |
| Compression Limit | The hard limit on how far this constraint can compress. |

[EXCERPT:Intro]
Unreal Engine 4 uses the PhysX 3.3 physics engine to drive its physical simulation calculations and perform all collision calculations. PhysX provides the ability to perform accurate collision detection as well as simulate physical interactions between objects within the world. Having physics in your game will help improve the immersion value of every scene, as it helps players believe that they are interacting with the scene and that the scene is responding back in some way or another.
