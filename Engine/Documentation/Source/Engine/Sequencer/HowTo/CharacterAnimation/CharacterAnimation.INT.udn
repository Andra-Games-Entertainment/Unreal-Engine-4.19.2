When creating cinematic sequences, there may be times where you want to have a character in your scene move around or perform some kind of animation. 
In **Sequencer**, this can be done by adding a Skeletal Mesh Actor to a Level Sequence, then adding an Animation sub-track, and then specifying the animation that you want the Actor to perform. 
Repeating this process and adding different kinds of animations for your Actor to perform is what can bring your characters to life in your cinematic sequences! 

In the following guide, you will create a small scene that starts with a character walking, then blending from walking into a jumping animation.

## Steps

[REGION:note]
For this guide, we are using the **Blueprint Third Person Template** project with **Starter Content Enabled**. 
[/REGION]

1.	Inside your project, from the Main Toolbar, click the **Cinematics** button, and then click the **Add Level Sequence** button.

1.	In the **Content Browser** under **Content/Mannequin/Character/Mesh**, drag the **SK_Mannequin** into the level.

1.	With the **SK_Mannequin** asset still selected, click the **Add** button in Sequencer to add it to your Level Sequence.

1.	Click the **Animation** button on the new Skeletal Mesh Track and assign the **ThirdPersonWalk** Animation Sequence.

1.	Expand **Animation**, then drag the **Timeline** to the **30** frame mark.

1.	Click the **Animation** button again and add the **ThirdPersonJump_Start** animation.

	If you play the animation now, you may notice a pop between the two animations.

	[REGION:tip]
	When adding animations, you can use the weight value to blend between multiple animations, which is how we will address the pop between animations. 
	[/REGION]

1.	Drag the **ThirdPersonJump_Start** animation below and under the walk animation, back to frame **25** of the sequence. 

	![](CharacterAnim_07.png)

1.	Expand both sub-animation tracks and click the **add key** button on the walk track with a value of **1.0** and **0.0** for the jump start animation. 

	![](CharacterAnim_08.png)

	[REGION:note]
	This will turn off the playback of the jump start animation since it's weighted value is `0.0`. 
	[/REGION]

1.	Scrub to frame **30** and add keys for both animations of **0.0** and **1.0** for the walk and jump animations respectively. 

	![](CharacterAnim_09.png)

	[REGION:note]
	This will blend in the jump start animation and blend out the walk animation. 
	[/REGION]

1.	Finally, click the **Preview Play** button to see the animation blending. 

## End Result

Your sequence now includes a Skeletal Mesh with multiple animations of which blend together smoothly instead of popping between animations.

If you want to continue working on this example, you can add the jump loop and jump end animations, blending them in so that the character jumps and lands.
