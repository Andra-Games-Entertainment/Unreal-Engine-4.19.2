For this Quick Start we are going to be re-creating the third shot that comes with the Composure content sample that you will find on the Epic Games Launcher. However before we can start to do this we are going to need to download a few additional files, create a new level, and make sure that we have the needed Actors and Blueprints. After completing this section, your project will be ready to start compositing computer generated footage with real world footage.

[region:note]
To fully follow along with this Quick Start you will need to download and create a new UE4 project that uses the Composure sample. You can the Composure sample on the learn tab of the Epic Games Launcher.

## Steps

1. First, download and extract the following .FBX file which contains the camera animation used for the third shot and nothing else.
*	**[Shot Three Undistorted Camera](https://epicgames.box.com/s/uymjfebmm2xw85tche0u2e60wqte58n3)**

1. From the Epic Games launcher, make sure you have downloaded and installed the Composure Sample project. If you already have the Composure sample, go ahead and launch it now.

1. Once the Composure sample has loaded go to **Edit** > **Plugins** and then in the **Compositing** section, make sure the following two plugins are enabled:
* **Composure**
* **Lense Distortion**
