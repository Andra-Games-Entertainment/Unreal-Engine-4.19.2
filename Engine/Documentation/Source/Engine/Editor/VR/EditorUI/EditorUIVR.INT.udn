## Docking

Windows are docked to one of the controllers when opened.

Moving a window that is docked to a controller will undock it, leaving it free floating in the world

Moving a free-floating window back to the controller will dock it.

## Interacting with Windows in VR Mode

There are a number of different ways you can interact with panels and windows in the VR Editor. Each window has a black bar along the bottom edge called the grip that can be used to "grab" the window and manipulate it.
