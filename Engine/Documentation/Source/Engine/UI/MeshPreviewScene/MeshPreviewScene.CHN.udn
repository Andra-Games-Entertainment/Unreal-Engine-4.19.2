Title: Mesh Preview Scenes
Crumbs: %ROOT%, Engine
Description:Mesh Preview Scenes
Version: 4.13



In the Static Mesh editor and Persona you can now set up preview scenes when inspecting your assets. This allows you to quickly assess what your assets would look like in multiple different 
environments and lighting scenarios very quickly without having to set up these scenes within the game viewport.

The Preview Scene Settings panel gives you control over various lighting settings and full control over the Post Process settings. 

* Directional Light�s Color, Intensity, and Rotation.
* Sky Light�s HDRI Environment Map, Intensity, and Rotation.
* Post Process Settings full control over all settings.


## Usage

Below you will find some examples of the settings that you can make to the Preview Scene Settings and examples of their usage.


### Using Scene Profiles

The Preview Scene Settings allow you to setup any number of environments and lighting scenarios to emulate your game levels. These scenes can be saved as any number of separate 
profiles that can be shared between the Static Mesh editor and Persona. Use the steps below to see how easy it is to add new profiles and to remove any unneeded ones. 


#### Adding Profiles

1. When you open the Static Mesh editor or Persona locate the panel on the right for **Preview Scene Settings**. 
	
	[REGION:imagetable]
	| [INCLUDE:#staticmesheditor] | [INCLUDE:#skeletalmesheditor] |
	| --- | --- |
	|Static Mesh Editor| Persona |
	| _Click for Full Image_ | _Click for Full Image_ |
	[/REGION]

2. Adjust the various settings until you have something that emulates the environment lighting and Post Processing settings you would like to use.

		[/PARAMLITERAL]
		[PARAMLITERAL:height]
		360
		[/PARAMLITERAL]
		[PARAMLITERAL:videoid]
		VxhRgJuxxwI
		[/PARAMLITERAL]
	[/OBJECT]

3. In the text box for **Profile Name**, give it a name that will be useful, like "Nighttime Environment" or "Daytime Environment".

	[REGION:lightbox]
	[![](ProfileName.png)(w:350)](ProfileName.png) 
	[/REGION]

4. Click on the button for **Add Profile**. 

	[REGION:lightbox]
	[![](AddingProfile.png)(w:350)](AddingProfile.png) 
	[/REGION]

5. You have now created and saved your profile and can select it from the drop-down next to **Scene Profile Settings**. 

	[REGION:lightbox]
	[![](ProfileSelection.png)(w:350)](ProfileSelection.png) 
	[/REGION]

	[REGION:warning]
	When adding additional profiles make sure to use the drop-down profile selector and choose the base "Profile_[X]" to save your new profile settings. If you fail to do this you will
	overwrite the current profile you have selected.
	[/REGION]

#### Removing Profiles

1. Select a profile from the drop-down selection next to **Scene Profile Settings**.

	[REGION:lightbox]
	[![](RemoveProfileSelection.png)(w:350)](ProfileSelection.png) 
	[/REGION]

2. Now click on the button for **Remove Profile** to permanently delete the currently selected profile.

	[REGION:lightbox]
	[![](RemoveProfileButton.png)(w:350)](ProfileSelection.png) 
	[/REGION]

3. You will now see that profile has been removed leaving only the Default profile and any other previously setup Profiles.

	[/REGION]


### Rotating the Environment

In this section, you will adjust the environment rotation which will rotate the skybox and the Directional Light around the mesh. This setting can be used to simply rotate the environment
around the mesh manually or to set a speed for the environment to rotate continually.


1. Enable environment rotation by placing a checkbox next to **Rotate Sky and Directional Lighting**.

	[REGION:lightbox]
	[![](RotatingEnvironment.png)(w:350)](RotatingEnvironment.png) 
	[/REGION]

2. Next, set a value for **Rotation Speed** for the environment to start rotating.

	![](RotationSpeed.png)(w:350)
	[OBJECT:EmbeddedVideo]
		[PARAMLITERAL:width]
		640
		[/PARAMLITERAL]
		[PARAMLITERAL:height]
		360
		[/PARAMLITERAL]
		[PARAMLITERAL:videoid]
		3GeYcT1isgE
		[/PARAMLITERAL]
	[/OBJECT]

	[REGION:note]
	If you only want to rotate the environment but not have it at a constant rotating speed you can use the slider for **Lighting Rig Rotation** to manually rotate the environment or you can hold
	the **L** key and left-click to only rotate the Directional light.
	[/REGION]

### Assigning an Environment Cube Map

In this section, you will learn how to assign a skybox for the environment for your preview scene.

1. Click the selection drop-down next to **Environment Cube Map** to select from the available HDRI cube maps available for use. 

	[OBJECT:EmbeddedVideo]
		[PARAMLITERAL:width]
		640
		[/PARAMLITERAL]
		[PARAMLITERAL:height]
		360
		[/PARAMLITERAL]
		[PARAMLITERAL:videoid]
		j8r1-Ws-33U
		[/PARAMLITERAL]
	[/OBJECT]


[REGION:tip]
Use the View Options for **Show Engine Content** to see additional cube maps that are included in the Engine Contents folder.

[REGION:lightbox]
[![](ViewOptions.png)(w:600)](ViewOptions.png)
[/REGION]
[/REGION]


### Post Process Settings

Like the Post Process Volume settings available in your game viewport, you have full control over all available Post Process settings for your preview scenes under the advanced rollout. 
You can toggle the post processing on and off for the Preview Scene by using the checkbox for **Post Processing Enabled**. 

[REGION:lightbox]
