**Distance Fields** are a powerful part of Unreal Engine 4 and are the basis for major features, including features heavily used in Epic's own games, such as dynamic Ambient Occlusion and Shadows. Distance Fields have also been extended for use with particle collision, dynamic indirect area shadows, and Materials, enabling you to create dynamic effects for soft bodies or dynamic flow maps for water.

Before you can get started using Distance Fields features, you'll need to enable it for your project.

## Enabling Mesh Distance Fields for your Project

1. Navigate to the menu and select **Edit** > **Project Settings** to open the project options window.

	[REGION:note]
	Mesh Distance Fields are only built if a Static Mesh exists in the current loaded level, when a Static Mesh is opened the Static Mesh Editor for the first time, or if the Distance Field Resolution is changed via the Build Settings in the Static Mesh Editor.

1. Once Distance Fields are built, you can use the visualization mode to see their representation by going to **Show** > **Visualize** > **Mesh Distance Fields** in the main viewport.
