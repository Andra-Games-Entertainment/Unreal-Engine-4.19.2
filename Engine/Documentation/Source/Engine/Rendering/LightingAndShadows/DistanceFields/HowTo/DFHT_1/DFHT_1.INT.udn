When you're developing your game, you may find that there are situations where dynamic lighting is the best choice for your scenes, like with large open worlds where precomputed lighting would be inefficient or too demanding on the target system's resources. **Ray Traced Distance Field Soft Shadows**, also referred to simply as **Distance Field Shadows**, enables you to have shadowing at farther distances than traditional **Cascaded Shadow Maps** (CSM) with a **Directional Light** would. For open world games, or long view distances in general, Distance Field Shadows can efficiently shadow beyond the CSM distance. This method was used extensively in the open world demo "A Boy and His Kite", which is available for download from the Epic Games Launcher via the Learn tab.

In this guide, we'll take a look at how to enable Distance Field Shadows for your light types and then explore the various settings that you can use with them.


## Steps

[REGION:note]
This feature requires that **Generate Mesh Distance Fields** be enabled in your **Project Settings** in the **Rendering** section.
[/REGION]

1. Start by navigating to the **Modes** window, then in the **Lights** section, select and drag a **Directional**, **Spot**, or **Point** Light into the main viewport. 

	![](ModesPanelLights.png)(w:400)
	
	[REGION:note]
	For the purpose of enabling Distance Field Shadows on any Light Actor, the process is the same. The additional sections of this guide will cover specific properties for these light types.
	[/REGION]

1. With the Light Actor selected, navigate over to its **Details** panel and set its **Mobility** to **Movable**.

1. Now, scroll down in the **Details** panel and under the **Distance Field Shadows** section, toggle the option for **RayTraced Distance Field Shadows**.

	[Region:imagetable]
	|![](DirectionalLightDFSettings.png)(w:450)|![](PointSpotLightSettingsDF.png)(w:450)|
	|---|---|
	| Directional Light | Spot/Point Light |
	[/Region]
	
	[REGION:note]
	If this option if grayed out, make sure that the light is set to **Movable** or that you've first enabled the option for **Generate Mesh Distance Fields** in your Project's Settings.
	[/REGION]
	
1. 	Now, Distance Field Shadows will be enabled for your lights that have this setting toggled on. Try dragging in a few Static Meshes from the Content Browser to see Distance Field Shadows working in your game.

	[REGION:tip]
	When using a Directional Light, it can be helpful to set the **Dynamic Shadow Distance Moveable Light** slider to **0**. This will disable CSM shadows so that you will only see the Distance Field Shadow of a mesh. This is also useful for testing your scene and diagnosing any potential Distance Field issues in addition to using the visualization mode for Mesh Distance Fields that you can enable in the main viewport by going to **Show** > **Visualize** > **Mesh Distance Fields**.

## Light Source Settings

When you decide on the type of light you want to use, whether it's a Directional, Spot, or Point Light, you will have different options that are avaialble. Below you'll find these settings that you can adjust and how to you use them for your Distance Field Shadows.

### Directional Light

Here you'll find the various settings that are available for Directional Lights that have Distance Field Shadows enabled.

![Distance Field Shadow Settings](DirectionalLightSettings.png)

[REGION:simpletable]
| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [REGION:tablesection]Light[/REGION] ||
| Light Source Angle | This is the light source's angle in degrees and is used to support soft area shadows for dynamic shadowing methods using Distance Fields or Capsule Shadows. | 
| [REGION:tablesection]Distance Field Shadows[/REGION] ||
| DistanceField Shadow Distance | This is the farthest distance that will have Distance Field Shadowing. Distance Field Shadows will also cover the distance between this value and the **Dynamic Shadow Distance Movable Light** for CSM shadows. | 
| RayTraced DistanceField Shadows | This will toggle Distance Field Shadows on for the light source. | 
| Distance Field Trace Distance  | This sets a distance in world units for how far shadows can cast from their shadow caster. When using larger values you will increase the shadowing cost for the scene. |
| Ray Start Offset Depth Scale | This controls how large an offset ray traced shadows have from the receiving surface as the camera gets further away. This can be used to hide self-shadowing artifacts from low-resolution distance fields on huge static meshes. | 
[/REGION]

#### Cascaded Shadow Maps VS Distance Field Shadows

Cascaded Shadow Maps provide higher quality shadowing but doesn't work well for long view distances, whereas Distance Fields can shadow over much farther distance more effeciently but rely on the resolution of their
Mesh Distance Field for quality. It's a good to use both in combination with one another to take advantage of the higher resolution CSM shadows at closer distances to your camera view and then use Distance Fields for 
the distant shadowing.

#### Light Source Angle

The **Light Source Angle** of a Directional Light will soften or sharpen the shadows based on the rotational angle of the light and the value entered. This setting only works with Distance Fields and Capsule Shadows and will not work with traditional shadow mapping where the shadow cannot easily be blurred.

The Light Source Angle has been set to 0, which you'll see that the shadows become realy sharp and crisp, even at father distances, while when using a higher value, the shadows will soften and spread out as they extend along the receiving surface.

	[/PARAM]
	[PARAM:after]
	![Light Source Angle: 1](DF_LSA1.png)(w:600)
	[/PARAM]
[/OBJECT]


#### Distance Field Trace Distance

The **Distance Field Trace Distance** controls how far a ray trace for shadowing can extend for any shadow caster. If you lower the value for the trace distance, you lower the cost of shadow casting for the scene 
because shadows will not draw beyond that point from their source. Keep in mind that the trace distance does not affect the shadow distance from the camera's view, which is instead controlled by **Distance Field Shadow Distance**.

The tree, in this example, is casting a shadow along the ground using its Mesh Distance Field. A trace distance of 1500 units (the default value is 10000), the tree's shadow doesn't capture the upper most branches and leaves since the shadows that would be cast from there are farther than 1500 units from the receiving surface.

### Point/Spot Lights
 
Here you'll find the various settings that are available for your **Spot** and **Point** Lights that have Distance Field Shadows enabled.
 
![](PointSpotLightSettings.png)
 
[REGION:simpletable]
| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------| 
| [REGION:tablesection]Light[/REGION] ||
| Source Radius | This is used as the size of the light source sphere. When you use larger values you get a larger penumbra, but it will cost more performance. |
| [REGION:tablesection]Distance Field Shadows[/REGION] ||
| RayTraced DistanceField Shadows | Whether to use ray traced distance field area shadows. | 
| Ray Start Offset Depth Scale | Controls how large of an offset ray traced shadows have from the receiving surface as the camera gets further away. This can be useful to hide self-shadowing artifacts from low-resolution distance fields on huge static meshes. | 
[/REGION]

#### Traditional Shadow Maps VS Distance Field Shadows

Similarly to CSM shadows, the shadow maps for Point and Spot lights have very detailed high quality shadows versus Distance Field Shadows, which can use the **Source Radius** of a light to control how soft or sharp the shadows are.

[OBJECT:ComparisonSlider]
	[PARAM:before]
	![Default Shadow Map](PointLight_CSM.png)(w:600)
	[/PARAM]
	[PARAM:after]
	![Distance Field Shadow](PointLight_DF.png)(w:600)
	[/PARAM]
[/OBJECT]

### Source Radius

The **Source Radius**, similar to the Light Source Angle in a Directional Light, is used to soften or sharpen the area shadows by adjusting the size of the light source itself. 

When using a lower value the shadows will become sharp throughout the light's attenuation radius, whereas high values will soften the shadows as they extend out from the shadow caster.

[OBJECT:ComparisonSlider]
	[PARAM:before]
	![Source Radius: 0.1](DF_LightSource1.png)(w:600)
	[/PARAM]
	[PARAM:after]
	![Source Radius: 20](DF_LightSource2.png)(w:600)
	[/PARAM]
[/OBJECT]

### Ray Start Offset Depth Scale

In some cases, low resolution Distance Fields or more complex geometry will produce self-shadowing artifacts. This can sometimes be offset by adjusting the **Distance Field Resolution** of your mesh, but you may not want to pay 
the higher cost of the generated volume texture that would be required. Instead, you can use the **Ray Start Offset Depth Scale** to control where the ray starts for shadows from the receiving surface as the camera moves further away. 

[OBJECT:ComparisonSlider]
	[PARAM:before]
	![Ray Start Offset Depth Scale: 0](DF_Depth0.png)(w:600)
	[/PARAM]
	[PARAM:after]
	![Ray Start Offset Depth Scale: 0.01](DF_Depth1.png)(w:600)
	[/PARAM]
[/OBJECT]


## End Result

Now that you've enabled Distance Fields Shadows for your different light types in your level and seen how to adjust the various settings for them, you should be able to apply these concepts to your own levels and games
using Distance Fields.
