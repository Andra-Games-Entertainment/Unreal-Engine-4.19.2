When your games rely on precomputed lighting with indirectly lit areas, it can be a challenge to have nice soft shadowing for your dynamic objects without faking it by using decals or complex materials. 
To solve this problem, **Distance Field Indirect Shadows** (DFIS) enables your dynamic Static Meshes to have soft area shadows in these areas where traditional shadow mapping techniques 
wouldn't work. Distance Field Indirect Shadows, similarly to how [Capsule Shadows](Engine/Rendering/LightingAndShadows/CapsuleShadows/Overview) for Skeletal Meshes samples the 
[indirect lighting cache](Engine/Rendering/LightingAndShadows/IndirectLightingCache/) to get the directionality and intensity of the indirect lighting to cast a soft area shadow using the Mesh Distance Field.

In this guide, we'll take a look at how to enable Distance Fields for meshes that can then be used in your levels for dynamic indirect shadowing.

## Steps

[REGION:note]
Unlike other Distance Field features, like those for [Ray Traced Distance Field Shadows](Engine/Rendering/LightingAndShadows/RayTracedDistanceFieldShadowing) and [Ambient Occlusion](Engine/Rendering/LightingAndShadows/DistanceFieldAmbientOcclusion), this feature can be enabled per-mesh instead of project-wide, which is detailed in the steps below.
[/REGION]

1. In the **Content Browser**, start by selecting any **Static Mesh** asset and double-clicking to open the Static Mesh Editor.

	For the purpose of this example, the Static Mesh **SM_Statue** from Sun Temple project (available on the Epic Games Launcher) will be used for the remainder of this demonstration.

1. In the Static Mesh Editor, navigate to the **Details** panel. In the **Static Mesh Settings** section, toggle the option for **Generate Mesh Distance Fields**. After enabling this, you can save and close the Editor window.

1. Now, go back to the **Content Browser**, where you selected the asset, and drag it into the Level Viewport.

1. With the Actor selected in your level, go to the **Details** panel and set the **Mobility** to **Movable**.

	Then, under the **Lighting** section, toggle the option for **Distance Field Indirect Shadow**.

1.	Once you've toggled the **Distance Field Indirect Shadows** option, your Static Mesh Actor will cast a soft area shadow when in precomputed, indirectly lit areas. With your own Static Mesh, you should see results similar to the example below.
	
	[REGION:note]
	If you're not seeing a soft shadow or drastically differing results, first make sure that you've already built lighting for the level and that you're testing in an area that gets a good amount of bounce light. In very brightly lit
	areas or areas directly lit by the light source, the indirect shadows will be practically non-existent.

### Distance Field Indirect Shadow Min Visibility

![](DFISMinVisibilitySetting.png)(w:450)

The setting for **Distance Field Indirect Shadow Min Visibility** controls how dark the movable Actor's indirect shadow can be. This settings gives artists the most control over how dark these shadows can be, enabling 
them to blend with surrounding precomputed shadows.

	[PARAM:before]
	![Min Visibility: 0.1 ](DFISMinVisibility_1.png)(w:550)
	[/PARAM]
	[PARAM:after]
	![Min Visibility: 0.6 ](DFISMinVisibility_2.png)(w:550)
	[/PARAM]
[/OBJECT]

	
	
## End Result

Now that you've seen how to use Distance Field Indirect Shadows, you should be able to enable your own Static Meshes to use dynamic indirect shadowing in your levels and individual actors, along with being able to adjust the shadows to blend nicely with your surrounding baked lighting in indirectly lit areas.
