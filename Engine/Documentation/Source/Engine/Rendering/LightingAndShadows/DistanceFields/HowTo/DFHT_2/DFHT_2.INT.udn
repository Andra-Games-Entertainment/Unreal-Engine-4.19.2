In your games, you may rely on screen space techniques to provide **Ambient Occlusion** (AO) or even precomputed lighting to make objects feel grounded in the world. These techniques are very useful, but have their
own limitations. **Screen Space Ambient Occlusion** (SSAO) is limited to using scene depth, which is limited to what's visible on screen, and precomputed methods only work for static objects in the world.
**Distance Field Ambient Occlusion** (DFAO) is a fully dynamic AO method using Mesh Distance Fields for your Static Mesh Actors and is not limited to only being used in dynamically lit worlds; it can easily be 
used with precomputed lighting as well. For additional information, you can read about [Distance Field Ambient Occlusion](Engine/Rendering/LightingandShadows/DistanceFieldAmbientOcclusion) in more detail.

In this guide, we'll take a look at how to enable DFAO with a Movable Sky Light Actor and then explore the various settings that you can use.


## Steps

[REGION:note]
This feature requires that **Generate Mesh Distance Fields** be enabled in your **Project Settings** in the **Rendering** section.
[/REGION]

1. Start by navigating to the **Modes** window, then in the **Lights** section, select and drag a **Sky Light** Actor into your Level Viewport.

1. With the Sky Light selected, navigate over to its **Details** panel and set its **Mobility** to **Movable**.

1. Now, Distance Field Ambient Occlusion will automatically be enabled for your scene. You can find the settings for **Distance Field Ambient Occlusion** in the Skylight's **Details** panel.

## Visualizing Distance Field Ambient Occlusion

To help you better see DFAO in action in your scene, and to help you troubleshoot or diagnose issues, you can use the visualization view mode by going to the main viewport and selecting **Show** > **Visualize** > **Distance Field Ambient Occlusion**.
Like other view modes, your viewport will change so that you can see the DFAO representation of your level.

## Distance Field Ambient Occlusion Settings

In the Sky Light Details panel, under **Distance Field Ambient Occlusion**, you'll find the settings available for artistic control of DFAO in your level.
 
 ![](DFAOProperties.png)(w:450)
 
| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Occlusion Max Distance | This is the maximum distance at which the occlusion of one point will affect another. By using higher values, you increase the cost of DFAO exponentially, but, in return, you get occlusion at a farther distance. |
| Contrast | This applies a contrast S-curve to the computed AO. A value of 0 means no contrast increase, whereas 1 is a significant contrast increase. |
| Min Occlusion | This controls the darkest that a fully occluded area can get. |
| Occlusion Tint | Artists can use this to control the Tint color for occluded areas. |

### Occlusion Max Distance

The **Occlusion Max Distance** controls the maximum distance between two points where occlusion of one can affect the other. When you adjust this distance, you're adjusting the accuracy that DFAO will have with other objects in the scene, which in turn means you're increasing the cost of it as well.

Using the two bottom-end and top-end values for the Occlusion Max Distance, a value of 200 units doesn't provide much detailed ambient occlusion, where a value of 1500 units is has a lot of ambient occlusion and looks more 
accurate for the scene but comes at a higher cost.

	![Occlusion Max Distance - 200](1_MaxOccl200.png)(w:700)
	[/PARAM]
	[PARAM:after]
	![Occlusion Max Distance - 1500](1_MaxOccl1500.png)(w:700)
	[/PARAM]
[/OBJECT]

### Contrast

The **Contrast** controls the difference in brightness between the objects affected by DFAO. The contrast value is clamped to be between 0 and 1, so you can use the slider to adjust the amount of contrast you will have in your scene.

Increasing the value for Contrast darkens a lot of the crevices and areas that are heavily occluded in this scene.

	[/PARAM]
	[PARAM:after]
	![Contrast - 1](1_Contrast_1.png)(w:700)
	[/PARAM]
[/OBJECT]

### Min Occlusion

The **Min Occlusion** controls how dark any fully occluded areas can get in your scene. This setting gives extra control to Artists to lighten DFAO in the occluded areas by using a higher value between 0 and 1.

Here the difference between a value of 0 and 1 is significant demonstrating how the occlusion is lightened for the scene, however, this setting works really well when also used with Contrast where you can darken 
occluded areas and then use the Min Occlusion to lighten how dark these areas can really get.

	[/PARAM]
	[PARAM:after]
	![Min Occlusion - 1](1_MinOccl_1.png)(w:700)
	[/PARAM]
[/OBJECT]


### Occlusion Tint

The **Occlusion Tint** affords Artists the most control over the look of DFAO by enabling the tint color for occluded areas to be adjusted. 

Occluded areas will be tinted based on these color values, which you can see here the difference between an Occlusion Tint that is black (the default color value) and red.

	![Tint Color - Black](1_OccTint_0.png)(w:700)

## End Result

Now that you've enabled Distance Field Ambient Occlusion for your level and seen how to adjust the various settings for it in your Sky Light, you should be able to control and tweak DFAO to fit your own 
games and levels for your stylistic needs.
