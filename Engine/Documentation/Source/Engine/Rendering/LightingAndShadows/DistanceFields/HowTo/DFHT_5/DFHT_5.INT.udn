When you open Static Meshes in the Editor, you'll find the **Build Settings** rollout in the Details panel under each **LOD** section. These properties serve to change aspects of your Static Meshes for your game, whether that is to generate a new lightmap all the way to changing the scale of the mesh without having to reimport or manually change it inside of your levels. You may have noticed that some of these settings are available in the Import Options window when you import your mesh, but some are more specialized, like the ones for Distance Fields that we'll be taking a look at in this guide.

Continue reading below to explore how the **Build Settings** options for Distance Fields can be used in your games that have them enabled.

## Distance Field Resolution Scale

The **Distance Field Resolution Scale** is used to increase the accuracy of the Mesh Distance Field representation, although this will significantly increase the memory cost of the volume texture used. In the Static Mesh Editor's viewport, you can use the stats in the corner to see what the volume texture's memory usage and size is.

	[/PARAM]
	[PARAM:after]
	![Distance Field Resolution Scale: 5](MeshView_2.png)(w:650)
	[/PARAM]
[/OBJECT]

The statue's Distance Field Resolution Scale has been increased from 1 to 5 and as a result you get a significant increase in resolution and visual quality, but at an increased cost; memory usage increases from 0.03 MB to 1.01 MB. 

## Generate Distance Field As If Two Sided

The setting for **Generate Distance Field as if Two-Sided** enables use with things like foliage, where you often have many sheets that make up the leaves of the plant. Since the Mesh Distance Fields feature operates by 
using surfaces this means that the ambient occlusion (AO) or shadows never really soften. When you toggle this option, the shadows and AO will soften which reduces the artifacts that can appear from an opaque Distance Field,
but it will cost more since the shadows are never fully opaque.

	[PARAM:before]
	![Generate Distance Field as if Two-Sided: On](DF_TS2.png)(w:650)
	[/PARAM]
	[PARAM:after]
	![Generate Distance Field as if Two-Sided: Off](DF_TS1.png)(w:650)
	[/PARAM]
[/OBJECT]

## Distance Field Bias

The setting for **Distance Field Bias** which enables you to reduce self-shadowing artifacts on ambient animations where the surface may move inside of the Mesh Distance Field or on complex geometry that has some minor 
self-shadowing.

[OBJECT:ComparisonSlider]
	[PARAM:before]
	![Distance Field Bias: 0 ](DF_Bias0.png)(w:650)
	[/PARAM]
	[PARAM:after]
	![Distance Field Bias: 1 ](DF_Bias1.png)(w:650)
	[/PARAM]
[/OBJECT]

The rock's crevices have some self-shadowing artifacts that appear, which can more clearly be seen with a simple base color applied. Increasing the Distance Field Bias shrinks the Mesh Distance Field inward so that 
parts of the mesh are no longer inside of it.

## Distance Field Replacement Mesh

The selection dropdown for **Distance Field Replacement Mesh** enables you to select any Static Mesh in your project to use as a replacement for the current meshes Distance Field representation. 

[OBJECT:ComparisonSlider]
	[PARAM:before]
	![Distance Field Replacement Mesh none selected ](DFReplace1.png)(w:650)
	[/PARAM]
	[PARAM:after]
	![Distance Field Replacement Mesh selected ](DFReplace2.png)(w:650)
	[/PARAM]
[/OBJECT]

The Distance Field representation can be swapped for another mesh when needed and in this demonstration a noticeably different mesh has been dilberately chosen, although you would likely use a mesh that is 
closely resembles the original mesh, but without as much complexity in geometry to keep the volume texture size lower and still retain the desired shape. 

## End Result

Now that you've explored the Build Settings specific to Distance Fields, you should have a better understanding of what these can do to help you optimize and improve quality for your projects that 
use them.
