Description: Capsule Shadows Reference
Version: 4.13


Use the following console commands to adjust the quality and various settings for how Capsule Shadows are represented in your game. 

<!---
| Console Variable | Description | Range | 
| ---------------- | ----------- | ----- |
| [r.CapsuleIndirectConeAngle](#Parameters) |	Light source angle used when the indirect shadow direction is derived from precomputed indirect lighting (no stationary skylight present). Default Value: 0.392699 | 0.1 - 1.0 |
| [r.CapsuleIndirectShadowMinVisibility](#capsuleindirectshadowminvisibility) |	Minimum visibility caused by capsule indirect shadows. This is used to keep the indirect shadows from going fully black. Default Value: 0.1 | 0.1 - 0.9 |
| r.CapsuleMaxDirectOcclusionDistance |	Maximum cast distance for direct shadows from capsules. �This has a big impact on performance. Default Value: 400 | 200-400 |
| r.CapsuleMaxIndirectOcclusionDistance |	Maximum cast distance for indirect shadows from capsules. This has a big impact on performance. Default Value: 200 | 200-400 |
| r.CapsuleShadowFadeAngleFromVertical |	Angle from vertical up to start fading out the indirect shadow, to avoid self shadowing artifacts. Default Value: 1.047198 | 1.0 - 2.0 |
| r.CapsuleShadows |	Whether to allow capsule shadowing on skinned components with bCastCapsuleDirectShadow or bCastCapsuleIndirectShadow enabled. |  |
| r.CapsuleShadowsFullResolution |	Whether to compute capsule shadows at full resolution. Disabled by Default. | - |
| r.CapsuleSkyAngleScale |	Scales the light source angle derived from the precomputed unoccluded sky vector (stationary skylight present) Default Value: 0.6 | 0.0 - 1.0 |

### Capsule Indirect Cone Angle

This command allows you to specify the light source angle for capsule's shadows when in indirectly-lit areas only and will not change the light source angle for any Directional Light in the scene.
The light source can have its mobility set to **Static** or **Stationary**, but if a Skylight is used in the scene its mobility must be set to **Static** in order for this command to work. 

Enter the following command followed by a value between 0.1 and 1.0 to adjust the light source angle that is used for the capsule's shadow representation. This command will only affect capsule shadows.

	r.CapsuleIndirectConeAngle
	
			
[OBJECT:ComparisonSlider]
	[PARAM:before]
	![Indirect Cone Angle = 0.392699 (Default)](IndirectConeAngle_Default.png)(w:600)
	[/PARAM]
	[PARAM:after]
	![Indirect Cone Angle = 0.55](IndirectConeAngle_55.png)(w:600)
	[/PARAM]
[/OBJECT]


### Capsule Indirect Shadow Minimum Visibility

This command allows you to adjust how visible the capsule's shadows are when in indirectly-lit areas. This is used to keep the indirect shadows from going fully black.
When using lower values the shadows will soften their intensity, whereas higher values will darken the shadows. 

Enter the following command followed by a value between 0.1 and 0.9 to adjust the minimum visibility for the indirect shadows.

	r.CapsuleIndirectShadowMinVisibility
	

[OBJECT:ComparisonSlider]
	[PARAM:before]
	![Indirect Shadow Minimum Visibility = 0.1 (Default)](DirectIndirectShadowsDefault.png)(w:600)
	[/PARAM]
	[PARAM:after]
	![Indirect Shadow Minimum Visibility = 0.55](IndirectShadMinVis_0_55.png)(w:600)
	[/PARAM]
[/OBJECT]


### Capsule Occlusion Distance

The commands for Direct Occlusion Distance and Indirect Occlusion Distance allows you to specify the maximum distance that the capsules can cast shadows in indirectly-lit and directly-lit areas.

[Region:warning]
By adjusting these values you can significantly impact performance.
[/REGION]

##### Direct Occlusion Distance

Enter the following command with a value for the distance, in centimeters, that the capsules should cast directly-lit shadows. 

	r.CapsuleMaxDirectOcclusionDistance 

[OBJECT:ComparisonSlider]
	[PARAM:before]
	![Direct Max Occlusion Distance = 400 (Default)](DirectDefault.png)(w:600)
	[/PARAM]
	[PARAM:after]
	![Direct Max Occlusion Distance = 200](MaxDirOccDist_200.png)(w:600)
	[/PARAM]
[/OBJECT]

##### Indirect Occlusion Distance

Enter the following command with a value for the distance, in centimeters, that the capsules should cast indirectly-lit shadows.

	r.CapsuleMaxIndirectOcclusionDistance 
		
[OBJECT:ComparisonSlider]
	[PARAM:before]
	![Indirect Max Occlusion Distance = 200 (Default)](IndirectDefault.png)(w:600)
	[/PARAM]
	[PARAM:after]
	![Indirect Max Occlusion Distance = 50 ](MaxIndirOccDist_100.png)(w:600)
	[/PARAM]
[/OBJECT]

### Capsule Shadow Fade Angle From Vertical

This command is helpful to avoid any self-shadowing artifacts that can happen in indirectly-lit areas where vertically aligned capsules can produce darker shadowing. Adjusting 
this value will fade the vertical influence angle.

Enter the following command followed by a value between 1.0 and 2.0 to adjust the fade for any self-shadowing artifacts that happen. Higher values will fade 

	r.CapsuleShadowFadeAngleFromVertical 

		
[OBJECT:ComparisonSlider]
	[PARAM:before]
	![Shadow Fade Angle from Vertical = 1.047198 (Default)](CSFadeVerticalDefault.png)(w:600)
	[/PARAM]
	[PARAM:after]
	![Shadow Fade Angle from Vertical = 1.9](CSFadeVertical1_9.png)(w:600)
	[/PARAM]
[/OBJECT]


<!---FULL RESOLUTION---
[Couldn't get this one to show any difference!]

### Capsule Shadows Full Resolution

Whether to compute capsule shadows at full resolution. Disabled by Default.

Type the following to enable full resolution of the Capsule Shadows.

	r.CapsuleShadowsFullResolution 1

<!---		
[OBJECT:ComparisonSlider]
	[PARAM:before]
	![Indirect Cone Angle = 0.392699 (Default)](IndirectCS_Default.png)(w:600)
	[/PARAM]
	[PARAM:after]
	![Indirect Cone Angle = 0.75](CapsuleIndirectConeAngle_75.png)(w:600)
	[/PARAM]
[/OBJECT]

### Capsule Sky Angle

The commands for the Minimum Sky Angle and the Sky Angle Scale allow you to adjust the light source angle when you have a Stationary Skylight in your scene. 

##### Mininmum Sky Angle

Enter the following command with a degree value between 0 and 90 to set the Stationary Skylight's minimimum light source angle. 

	r.CapsuleMinSkyAngle

		
[OBJECT:ComparisonSlider]
	[PARAM:before]
	![Min Sky Angle = 15.0 (Default)](DirectIndirectShadowsDefault.png)(w:600)
	[/PARAM]
	[PARAM:after]
	![Min Sky Angle = 35.0](MinSkyAngle_35.png)(w:600)
	[/PARAM]
[/OBJECT]


##### Sky Angle Scale

Enter the follwing command with a value between 0 and 1.0 to scale the light source angle derived from the Stationary Skylight in your scene.            

	r.CapsuleShadowsSkyAngleScale
		
[OBJECT:ComparisonSlider]
	[PARAM:before]
	![Sky Angle Scale = 0.6 (Default)](DirectIndirectShadowsDefault.png)(w:600)
	[/PARAM]
	[PARAM:after]
	![Sky Angle Scale = 0.1](SkyAngleScale_0_1.png)(w:600)
	[/PARAM]
