In the previous step, we assigned our Physics Asset to our Character's Skeletal Mesh as its Shadow Physics Asset. 
This will enable us to use it for soft shadowing in our levels in direct and indirectly lit areas.

**Steps:**

1. Inside the **Content Browser**, navigate to the folder named **ThirdPersonBP**, then open the **Blueprints** folder. Double-click to open **ThirdPersonCharacter** Blueprint.

1. In the ThirdPersonCharacter Blueprint, in the **Components** Window select **Mesh (Inherited)**. In the Details Panel, on the right, navigate down to the **Lighting** tab under the advanced rollout and enable the following: 
	* **Capsule Direct Shadows**
	* **Capsule Indirect Shadows**

1. Now that these are set, you can **Save** & **Close** the ThirdPersonCharacter Blueprint.

1. Before we test our Capsule Shadows we need to create some indirectly lit areas in our level. In your Level Viewport, select the **Floor** mesh and then hold the **ALT** key while **Left-clicking** to drag a copy up along the Z-axis. 
Move the floor mesh to the top of the outer walls. Now use the X-axis on the translation tool to move it back so that only part of the floor area is covered.

1. Now select the **Direcitonal Light**, named "Light Source," from the **World Outliner**. In its Details Panel set the **Intensity** for the light to **10**.

**End Result:**

You now have a character that supports Capsule Shadowing for direct and indirectly lit areas. You can move around the scene to see the how the soft shadows work while sun lit areas or in areas that are
covered and only receive bounce lighting, like under the ceiling we created for part of the level.

You can enable both Capsule Shadow settings individually depending on the needs of your game or project. These settings enable soft shadowing to make the character blend in with statically lit environments and to make the 
character feel grounded in indirectly lit areas where normal shadowing techniques don't work well for dynamic Actors. 

In the next and final step, there are some "On Your Own" challenges you can attempt and reminders for creating your Shadow Physics Asset, along with some links to additional documentation.
