In Unreal Engine 4, you can now output to High Dynamic Range (HDR) displays taking advantage of features such as higher contrast and wider color gamut! The goal here is to give the displayed images the
characteristics that are more like natural light conditions experienced in the "real world". This is part of the move to the **Academy Color Encoding System** (ACES) standard that is a pipeline to ensure
consistent color is preserved across multiple formats and displays, and also as a way to _future-proof_ the source material used without having to adjust it for another medium.

with the current implementation, the full processing of the rendered scene is handled through what is known as the **ACES Viewing Transform**. This process works by using scene-referred and display-referred images.

* **Scene-referred** images maintain the original _linear light_ values of the source materials without limiting the exposure range. 
* **Display-referred** is the final image transformed into the color space of the display being used. 

By using this pipeline, the original source files do not have to be edited each time they are used with a different display in order to guarantee correct coloring. Instead, the display being output to maps it to the 
correct color space.

The ACES Viewing Transform, more specifically, works in the following order in the viewing pipeline:

* **Look Modification Transform (LMT)** - This part of the process takes the ACES color-encoded image that has had a creative "look" (color grading and correction) applied to it and then outputs the images rendered with
ACES in combination with the Reference Rendering Transform (RRT) and an Output Device Transform (ODT).
* **Reference Rendering Transform (RRT)** - Then, this part takes the scene-referred color values and converts them to display-referred. In this process, it enables the rendered images to not rely on a specific display
and, instead, can ensure a larger gamut and dynamic range that is correct for the specific display it's being output to, including ones that have yet to be created.
* **Output Device Transform (ODT)** - Finally, this takes the HDR Data output of the RRT to then match it with the different devices and color spaces they can display. Because of this, each target requires its own
ODT to be matched against (eg Rec709, Rec2020, DCI-P3, etc.).


## Enabling HDR Output

You can enable HDR output at runtime by toggling the console variables or by using the **GameUserSettings** node in Blueprints. 

![](HDRGameUserSettings.png)(w:800)

The **GameUserSettings** controls will automatically clamp to the closest available match for the current output device and set all flags accordingly. Alternatively, you can use the following console variables to enable
and change the available options for the HDR device and color gamut output need. 

[REGION:simpletable]
| Console Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `r.HDR.EnableHDROutput` | When set to 1, this recreates the swap-chain and enables HDR output. |
| `r.HDR.Display.OutputDevice` | This is the device format of the output display [INCLUDE:#deviceOuptut] |
| `r.HDR.Display.ColorGamut` | This is the color gamut of the output display. [INCLUDE:#colorGamut] |
[/REGION]

| 2 | Explicit gamma mapping (LDR) |

| 4 | ACES 2000-nit ST-2084 (Dolby PQ) (HDR) |
| 5 | ACES 1000-nit ScRGB (HDR) |
| 6 | ACES 2000-nit ScRGB (HDR) |
[/EXCERPT:deviceOuptut]

[EXCERPT:colorGamut]

| 2 | Rec2020 / BT2020, D65 |
| 3 | ACES, D60 |
| 4 | ACEScg, D60 |
[/EXCERPT:colorGamut]

Once you've setup the Blueprint or C++ call for GameUserSettings, you can run any cooked project, use the command line argument `-game mode`, use Standalone game mode, or Play-in-Editor (PIE) in a new window using 
exclusive fullscreen (press **Alt** + **Enter** or use the command `fullscreen`). Using borderless windowed or windowed mode will not currently work for HDR output. 


### Low Dynamic Range (LDR) UI support in HDR

[REGION:note]
This feature is experimental and may change in a future release.
[/REGION]

There is support for bringing Low Dynamic Range (LDR) 

When HDR output has been enabled your User Interface (UI) may not look correct. We've added experimental support for LDR UI composition for this reason. It attempts to match the
LDR look as closely as possible, although, it's recommended to boost the UI slightly to avoid looking washed out next to the vibrancy of the main scene. 

To do this, you can use the following console variables:

[REGION:simpletable]
| Console Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `r.HDR.UI.CompositeMode` | When set to 1, this enables HDR UI composition, which attempts to preserve LDR visuals and blending. |
| `r.HDR.UI.Level` | This adjusts the brightness of the composited UI. It is recommended to use a value of 1.5 or 2. |

## HDR Hardware and Setup Considerations

With the many different types of displays and TVs that are available, along with console and PC considerations, you may find that you need to use a specific piece of hardware or change a setting to get 
HDR output to work properly. The following are some things to consider when you're running through your setup process:

* Make sure that your system is connected to the HDR display using a high-speed HDMI 2.0 cable so that you can take advantage of the transfers speeds. (HDMI 1.4 may work, but may have issues displaying the content.)
Not all HDMI ports may accept HDMI 2.0 and HDR. Refer to your display's manual if you're unsure. 
* Ensure that the TV port is HDR enabled. Sometimes this may be listed in your TV or display settings as "HDMI Deep Color" or "Enhanced Format." Refer to your display's manual if you're unsure.
* With some consoles, like the PS4, you may need to disable the system setting for **Enable HDCP** for HDR output to work properly.
* For some displays, you may need to adjust display settings to get the correct output. 
	* With NVIDIA GPUs, use the NVIDIA Control Panel and adjust the display resolution Output Color Format to use **RGB** and the Output Color Depth to use **10-bit** or **12-bit**.

## Notes and Limitations

* By default, the film-mapping curve is disabled during HDR output due to poor compatibility with LDR controls. 
* Currently, only paths for 1000-nit and 2000-nit display outputs are implemented. 
* D3D11 restrictions limit HDR output to exclusive fullscreen support only. With D3D12 support in Windows 10, this can likely be extended to enable individual viewports for HDR Output. The implementation on Mac currently supports this, already.
