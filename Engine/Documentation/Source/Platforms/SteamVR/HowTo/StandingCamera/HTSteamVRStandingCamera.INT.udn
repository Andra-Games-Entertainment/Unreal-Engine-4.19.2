One of the first things you will need to think about when starting to develop any UE4 powered VR experience to be used with the Steam VR is deciding whether the experience will be a seated one or a standing one. In the following How - To we will take a look at how to setup your UE4 projects VR camera for a standing Steam VR experience.

## Pawn Setup for a Standing Steam VR Experience

    [region:note]
    No matter what VR HMD you are using, this is the Epic recommend way to set up a VR camera as it allows you to offset the position of the camera without having to move the actual camera.

With that completed, the initial setup for the VR Camera is now completed, in the next sections, we will go through setting the needed Blueprint logic for a standing Steam VR experience.
