In this step we will use the Stereo Panoramic plugin to capture the iamges of the level in stereo 3D.

## Steps

1. From the **Main Toolbar** press the **Play** button and then navigate your player to an area that you want to capture. For this example we will be leaving the player in the middle of the Static Mesh but feel free to position the player anywhere you want to.

1. Press the **Backtick** key (`) on the keyboard to open up the UE4 console and then input the following command. Once the command has been input press the Enter key to execute the command.

	* **SP.PanoramicScreenshot**

	[region:note]
	Instead of typing out SP.PanoramicScreenshot in it's entirety, you can just type **SP.P** and then select SP.PanoramicScreenshot from the displayed list using the arrow keys. Once SP.PanoramicScreenshot is selected, press the Enter key to execute the command.

1. During the capture process the editor might appear to be frozen or unresponsive for a few seconds / minutes.  This is due to the demanding rendering requirements of the Stereo Panoramic  plugin. When the editor becomes responsive again you will be able to find the screenshots in the following location in your projects folder.

	[region:note]
	If the image previews look washed in thumbnail images or when viewed in an image viewer it is because the Stereo Panoramic plugin will add an alpha channel to the output .PNG file.
