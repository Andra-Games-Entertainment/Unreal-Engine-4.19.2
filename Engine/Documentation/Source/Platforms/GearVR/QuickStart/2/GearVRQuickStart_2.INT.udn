## Steps

1. Once the project has finished being created and compiled, Visual Studio will automatically open (if already installed) along with the editor.

	[region:note]
	If you are using Unreal Engine 4.8 or later and a Blueprint based project, Visual Studio will not open up as it is not needed. 
	[/region]

1. Once the UE4 Editor has loaded, from the **Main Toolbar**, open the **Windows** tab and select the **Plugins** menu.

1. From the **Plugins** menu, go to the **Head Mounted Displays** section, **disable** the **Oculus** option, and **enable** the **Gear VR** option. Then, click the **Restart Now** button to re-start the editor so the changes can take place.

1. Next, scroll down till you see the **Configure the Android Manifest for deployment to Gear VR** checkbox and enable it. 

	[Region:note]
	This step is of vital importance as without this on your project will not be able to run on the Gear VR Headset.
	[/region]

1. Next, under the **Android SDK** section, fill-in the location of the required Android SDK files on your development PC. 
	You can find the needed folders in the location where you installed the Tegra files. 
	
	[Region:note]
	If you have already installed CodeWorks for Android 1R6, this information should be already filled in for you. The only reason that you should change something here is if the information is missing or pointing to the wrong location.

1. Finally, under **File** > **Package Project** > **Packing Settings**, un-check **Full Rebuild** to help speed up iteration times. 

	[Region:note]
	Remember to **Re-Enable** this option when your project is ready for its final publish to ensure that your project will work as intended on the Gear VR Headset.
