Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) uses a special version of the Android Software Development Kit (SDK), called **CodeWorks for Android 1R4**. 
This version of CodeWorks for Android is the easiest way to set up the SDK and Native Development Kit (NDK) needed to develop 
Android projects with UE4. Although we're currently using version 1R4, we intend to use subsequent releases of CodeWorks. 
If you have other versions of the Android SDK installed (or, older versions of CodeWorks for Android), we recommend that you 
uninstall them and install CodeWorks for Android, using the CodeWorks for Android installer that's being distributed with UE4. 

[region:note]
We've bundled the CodeWorks for Android installer with UE4 to make sure that your Android SDK will be compatible with Unreal Engine.

## Goals

The focus of this Android Quick Start guide is to walk you through the basics of setting up your computer for Android Development with UE4.
This guide also teaches you how to put a template game on your Android device with the Unreal Editor's launching and packaging features.

## Objectives

* Install and set up the Android SDK.
* Setting up your Android device for development.
* Creating a project that is targeted for Android mobile development.
* How to deploy a level to your Android device
* How to package your game for release.
