On the following page, you will find information on how to make sure your UE4 project will work with the Oculus Rift HMD. 

## Enabling Unknown Sources 

While you're developing your Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) Virtual Reality (VR) project, it's best to enable allow **Unknown Sources** so you can run your application with having to have it be registered or reviewed by Oculus. To enable the **Unknown Sources** option, you will need to do the following:

1. Open the Oculus Store then click on the **Gear** icon that is in the upper right-hand corner to expose the **Settings** menu option, then click on the word **Settings**.
