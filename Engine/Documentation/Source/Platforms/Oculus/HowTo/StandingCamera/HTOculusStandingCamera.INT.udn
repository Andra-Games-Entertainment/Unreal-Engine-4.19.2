One of the first things you will need to think about when starting to develop any UE4 powered VR experience to be used with the Oculus Rift is deciding whether the experience will be a seated one or a standing one. In the following How - To we will take a look at how to setup your UE4 projects VR camera for a standing Oculus Rift experience.
