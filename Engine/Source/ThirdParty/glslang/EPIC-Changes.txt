* ResourceLImits.h Add #define ENABLE_HLSL 1
* check() doesn't work as it's on a header that ends up used in the Engine which conflicts with our macro check(), rename to Check()
* Relaxed promotions for mobile profiles, Intermediate.cpp:
	bool TIntermediate::canImplicitlyPromote(TBasicType from, TBasicType to) const
	{
		//#Epic - Allow more conversions
		//if (profile == EEsProfile || version == 110)
		//    return false;
